        <div class="content" style="margin-top: 40px;">
            <p>What if we could model the human body in a way that would create a perfect simulation of it? Apart from the obvious consequences, what would emerge?</p>

<p>Why has this not been done already? Will need to go deeper into this.</p>

<p>What would the best approach be? </p>

<p>Originally, I was planning on creating a simple mathematical framework to describe physiological processes, but it has occured to me it will be worth the struggle to create a computational framework as well.</p>

<p>Will also need to ensure I am aware of the work being done in this space.</p>

<p>What would the intersection between the omics and this full body simulation look like?</p>

<p>What about modelling medications and similar (e.g. PBPK Model)?</p>
